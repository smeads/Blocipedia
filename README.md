#### Authentication with Devise:
Blocipedia incorporates [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for user authentication. The authentication system allows users to sign up and send emails for account confirmation. Additionally, users can sign in and out of Blocipedia.

#### Authorization with Pundit:
Blocipedia uses [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) for authorization. There are three roles, standard (free), premium, or admin. When a user signs up the role defaults to standard.

#### Upgrading an Account:
Blocipedia utalizes [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to charge users before switching their account role from standard to premium. A user can downgrade at anytime.

#### Markdown Capabilities:
Using [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) Blocipedia gives users the ability to use Markdown syntax.
